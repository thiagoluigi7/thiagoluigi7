## About me

As a developer, my journey in the world of technology began with a strong focus on backend development, having gained experience with various well-established technologies in the field, such as AWS services (Lambda, RDS, S3, SQS, SNS, Step Function, Event Bridge), NestJS, PostgreSQL, Typescript, Javascript, and NodeJS. Over time, I also acquired some experience in frontend development, having worked with React, NextJS, TailwindCSS, HTML and CSS. I am always willing to take on new challenges and learn new technologies. My career has been dedicated to building robust and scalable solutions, both on the server and on the client side. 

During my Computer Science graduation, I had the opportunity to participate in study groups that expanded my knowledge. I was a member of the NESCAU group, which focused on digital security within the Computer Science department at the Federal University of Lavras, from 2018 to 2020. Additionally, I was part of a study group on natural language processing and artificial intelligence in the same department, from 2018 to 2021. 

These academic and professional experiences have shaped my passion for technology and my constant pursuit of learning and growth. I am eager to apply this knowledge to future projects and contribute to innovative solutions.
